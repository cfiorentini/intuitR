intuitR
=======

An efficient SAT-based theorem prover for Intuitionistic Propostional Logic [1].

It is implemented on the top of the prover [intuit](https://github.com/koengit/intuit)
by Claessen and Rosen.


In the directory [documents](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/documents) you can find:

-  a full version of the paper with appendix ([pdf](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/documents/intuitR_withAppendix.pdf));
-  the slides presented at  CADE 2021 ([pdf](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/documents/slidesCADE2021.pdf)).



The directory  [examples](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/examples)  contains the output files generated by
`intuitR` with the formulas &chi; and &psi; defined in Examples 1 and 2 [1].


An implementation of `intuit` with the trace of computations and the
construction of derivations/countermodels is available at the
directory [intuitT](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/intuitT) (see the corresponding README file).

Haskell installation
-------------------

You have to install the [Haskell toolchain](https://www.haskell.org/downloads)
(see  the section  [Installation instructions](https://www.haskell.org/downloads#ghcup)), 
in particular:

- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/): the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
- [cabal-install](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.6/): the Cabal installation tool for managing Haskell software.



IntuitR compilation
-------------------

From the  root directory (i.e., the directory containing the file  `intuitR.cabal`) run the command:

```console
 cabal install
```

It should be printed a message like this:

```console
 ....
 Symlinking 'intuitR' to '/myHome/.cabal/bin/intuitR'
```

This means that `intuitR` is the command to launch the prover. Actually,
`intuitR` is a symbolic link to    `/myHome/.cabal/bin/intuitR`; if
the command `intuitR` is not found you have to add the directory `/myHome/.cabal/bin/` to
your `PATH` variable (or write the complete path of the command).


To print the usage help:


```console
intuitR -h
```



Running
-------

The input formula must be written in a text file. A formula `F` is specified by the following syntax:

```console
  F :=     atom          // prop. variable
        |  $false        // false
        |   ~F           // not 
        |  F & F         // and
        |  F | F         // or
        |  F => F        // implication 
        |  F <=> F       // bi-implication
```
Examples of formulas:
```console
(a => b) | ( b => a )
a | (a => b | ~b)
~ a | ~~a
( ((a1 <=> a2) =>  a1 & a2 & a3) & ((a2 <=> a3)  =>  a1 & a2 & a3)  & (( a3 <=> a1)  => a1 & a2 & a3 ) )  =>  a1 & a2 & a3  
```

You can also use the [TPTP syntax](http://tptp.cs.miami.edu/TPTP/QuickGuide/Problems.html);
the files `chi.p` and `psi.p` in  the directory  [test](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/test)
encodes the formulas  &chi; and &psi; in TPTP syntax (see Examples 1 and 2).
The files .p in the directory  [Benchmarks](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/Benchmarks)   are written in  TPTP syntax. 

To decide the validity of the formula in the file `form.p`, run the command:

```console
 intuitR form.p
```

To generate the output files with the trace of the computation and the derivation or countermodel:

```console
 intuitR -t form.p
```

A directory out-...  will be created containing  the source files (.tex and .gv).
To compile them, move into such a directory and enter the command `make`.

Note that:

-  files .tex  are compiled using  `pdflatex`; derivations are built using the Latex package [proof](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~tatsuta/proof-sty.html).

-  files .gv   are compiled using the command `dot` of
   [Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software](https://graphviz.org/).

Both the commands `pdflatex` and `dot` must be in your PATH variable.
If something goes wrong, try to execute the commands:

```console
pdflatex your_file.tex
dot your_file.gv -Tpng -o out.png
```


We have implemented four different  trace levels:

```console
 intuitR -t0 form.p     // minimum trace level, no output files 
 intuitR -t1 form.p     // medium  trace level, no output files 
 intuitR -t2 form.p     // maximum trace level, no output files 
 intuitR -t  form.p     // maximum trace level  with output files 
```



Running Benchmarks
------------------

The directory [Benchmarks](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/Benchmarks)
contains the files corresponding to the 1200 problems used in the
experiments (actually, the 28 problems not solved by `intuitR` and
`intuit` within 600secs have been moved into the subdirectory
 [_other_benckmarks_SYJ202](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/Benchmarks/_other_benckmarks_SYJ202)).

To run the benchmarks and get e report, from your local directory
`script` run the commands `run_benchmarks.sh` and `build_report.sh`;
both commands need as parameter the timeout to be used (in seconds).
For instance, if the timeout is 600 secs run:

```console
 run_benchmarks.sh 600
 build_report.sh 600
```

Note that  command  `intuitR` must be in your PATH variable.
If you have installed [intuit](https://github.com/koengit/intuit),
the script also performs the tests with `intuit`.

To translate the benchmarks into
[fCube](http://www2.disco.unimib.it/fiorino/fcube.html) and
[IntHistGC](https://github.com/jessezwu/IntHistGC) syntax, run:

```console
 generate_fCube_benchmarks.sh
 generate_IntHistGC_benchmarks.sh
```

Both scripts invoke `intuitR`.

Experiments
-----------

The directory   [timings](https://github.com/cfiorentini/intuitR/tree/main/timings)   contains a detailed account of the
experiments we have performed with timeout 600 seconds on a machine 

```console
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz, 16GB memory
